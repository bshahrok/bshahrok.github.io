I am a researcher in learning analytics and speech technologies, and I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in December 2025. My work bridges multimodal machine learning, speech and language technologies, and educational data science. I focus on modeling complex human learning behaviors using audio, linguistic, and contextual signals, with applications in classroom activity understanding, collaborative learning, and human–AI interaction. I have developed high-performing multimodal and LLM-enhanced pipelines, contributed to research in CSCL and AI-in-education. My broader goal is to design interpretable, data-driven models that deepen our understanding of learning processes and support more equitable and effective educational technologies.
